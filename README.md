# NeuroPY
This is our project made with PLY, which is a reimplementation of the classical lex-yacc combo.

## Status
So far the lexer and parser have an initial implementation, that allows them to recognize specific patterns in their input.
- Lex.py contains the lexer/scanner: A module to convert characters (user input) into tokens which are fed to the parser
- Yacc.py contains the parser: A module to convert tokens into a specialized tree data structure.
